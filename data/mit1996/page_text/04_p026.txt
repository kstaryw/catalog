3-1-8 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Presents and applies modern ship production
methods in a total ship system and concurrent
engineering context. Reviews basic fabrication
and material handling processes. Major topics
include design/production integration, build
strategy, group technology zone construction,
shipyard layout, CAD/CAM, accuracy control,
process planning, and scheduling. Examines
design concepts to enhance producibility and
reduce cost/environment impact. Uses case
studies and projects.
