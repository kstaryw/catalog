Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Course 1
1.107 Aquatic Chemistry Laboratory
Prereq.: 5.11
U (Spring)
2-6-4 Institute LAB
Field sampling and laboratory analysis techniques for determining chemical (e.g., salinity,
metals, 02, nutrients, haloforms, petroleum
hydrocarbons) and biological (e.g., chlorophyll,
phytoplankton growth rates) parameters in
aquatic samples. Both wet-chemical and instrumental (e.g., atomic absorption
spectrometry and gas chromatography)
methods. Field trips are taken to acquire "real
world" samples for analysis and interpretation
of the data in terms of water quality and the
processes affecting it. An independently
designed final project is required. Enrollment
limited to 16 per section.
