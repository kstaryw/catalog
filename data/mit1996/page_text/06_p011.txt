Two options offered, both covering fundamentals of mathematical analysis: convergence of
sequences and series, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integral, sequences and
series of functions, uniformity, interchange of
limit operations. Both options show the utility of
abstract concepts and teach understanding
and construction of proofs. Option A, offered
first term only, chooses less abstract definitions and proofs, and gives applications where
possible. Option B is more abstract and for students with more mathematical maturity. Places
greater emphasis on point-set topology.
