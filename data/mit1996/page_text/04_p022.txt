2-1-6 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Examines the interaction of the atmosphere
and ocean on time scales from hours to
months, with emphasis on effects within the
boundary layers. Methods for measuring and
computing air/sea fluxes are reviewed, and students who participate in the optional laboratory
subject at WHO can build and use the
relevant instruments. Modification of boundary
layers by air/sea exchange, radiation and turbulent mixing is treated using a hierarchy of
boundary layer models that are available on
Athena for student use.
