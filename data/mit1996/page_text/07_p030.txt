22.823 Nuclear Industry Dynamics
Prereq.: 22.211
G (Spring)
3-0-9 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Introduction to techniques for modeling and understanding the interaction of nuclear plant
operations with the external world of safety
and economic regulation, public concern, and
financial issues. The system dynamics technique is introduced by application to nuclear
plant construction and then focuses on modeling the interrelations between plant management and operations, the regulatory
environment, the financial environment, and
the public sector.

Magnetic Resonance
(New)
Prereq.: Permission of instructor
G (lAP)
1-2-0 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Hands-on introduction to NMR presenting
background in classical theory and instrumentation. Each lecture followed by lab experiments both to demonstrate ideas presented
during the lecture and to familiarize students
with state-of-the-art NMR instrumentation. Experiments cover topics ranging from spin
dynamics to spectroscopy, and include imaging.

22.921 Nuclear Power Plant Dynamics and
Control
Prereq.: Graduate Level
G (IAP)
1-0-2
Nuclear power plant dynamics involve unique
non-linear systems due to delayed neutron effects and to thermally induced feedback effects. Engineers need to understand these; the
rapid development of digital systems with control applications affords ideal methods for solving the non-linear control problems with
systems that are insensitive to human error.
Subject includes lectures and demonstrations
with computer simulation and the use of the
MIT Research Reactor.
