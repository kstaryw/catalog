3.986 Introduction to Archaeology
(Revised Units)
(21A.103)
Prereq.: -
U (Fall)
3-2-4 HASS
Humans have modified their natural environment for over two million years. Archaeology
reconstructs ancient human activity (subsistence, architecture, materials processing, and
technology) and its environmental context from
material remains using specialized techniques,
many of which are laboratory-based. Drawing
on case studies in contrasting environmental
settings from the Americas and the Old World,
subject considers these activities and the forces that shaped them. In laboratory sessions,
students analyze various classes of archaeological materials, among them ceramics,
stone, and metal.

3.987 Human Origins and Evolution
(21A.105)
Prereq.: -
U (Spring)
3-0-6 HASS
Examines the dynamic interrelations among
physical and behavioral traits of humans and
environment and culture to provide an integrated framework for studying human biological evolution and modern diversity. Topics
include issues in morphological evolution and
adaptation; fossil and cultural evidence for
human evolution from earliest times through
the Pleistocene; evolution of tool use and social behavior; modern human variation and
concepts of race. Includes study of stone artifacts and fossil specimens.

3-0-6 HASS
Examines prehistory and modern ethnographic
diversity of technology on the African continent, with particular emphasis on the subSaharan region. Traces the course of human
technological evolution from the earliest PlioPleistocene tool-making hominids to the
modern ethnical diverse inhabitants of the continent, by way of topical case studies. These
cases are centered on subsistence adaptations and technological responses. Includes
lectures, experience handling prehistoric stone
artifacts and modem ethnographic items, and
ethnographic films.
