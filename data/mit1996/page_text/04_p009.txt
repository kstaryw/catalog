12.104 Geochemistry of the Earth and
Planets
Prereq.: 18.02
Acad Year 1996-97: U (Spring)
Acad Year 1997-98: Not offered
3-1-8
Focuses on the processes that create chemical variability in the solid and fluid earth. the
moon, and meteorites. Includes nucleosynthesis, cosmochemistry, and basic geochemical concepts. Thermodynamics and phase
equilibria are introduced and applied to
problems of melting solid planetary interiors
and the evolution of the earth's hydrosphere.
Radiogenic and stable isotopic systems are
used to document the timing of planetary formation and differentiation, formation, and
evolution of volcanoes and continental crust,
and to understand interactions between the
solid and fluid earth.

12.108 Structure of Earth Materials
Prereq.:
U (Fall)
3-0-9 REST
The geologic record demonstrates that our environment has changed over a variety of time
scales from seconds to billions of years. Subject explores the many ways in which geologic
processes control and modify the Earth's environment. Topics include: chemical and physical interactions between the solid Earth, its
oceans and atmosphere; the effect of
catastrophic events such as volcanic eruptions
and earthquakes on the environment; geologic
hazards; and our role in modifying the environment through earth resource development.
This subject serves as an introduction to subject 12.120, which addresses field applications
of these principles in the American Southwest.

Provides a comprehensive introduction to crys- talline structure, crystal chemistry, and bonding in rock-forming minerals. Introduces the
theory relating crystal structure and crystal
symmetry to physical properties such as refractive index, elastic modulus, and seismic
velocity. Surveys the distribution of silicate,
oxide, and metallic minerals in the interiors
and on the surfaces of planets and discusses
the processes that led to their formation.

Prereq.: 12.104, 12.108
Acad Year 1996-97: Not offered
Acad Year 1997-98: U (Fall)
3-6-3
Surveys the distribution, chemical composition,
and mineral associations in rocks of the earth's
crust and upper mantle, and establishes their
relation to tectonic environment. Emphasis is
on the use of chemistry and physics to interpret rock forming processes. Topics include:
dynamics of crust and mantle melting as
preserved in the chemical composition of igneous rocks and minerals, the long-term
record of global climate change as preserved
in the minerals of sedimentary rocks, and the
time-temperature-depth record preserved in
minerals of metamorphosed crustal rocks.
