Department of Mechanical Engineering Course 2
2.75 Precision Machine Design
Prereq.: 2.72 or permission of instructor
G (Fall)
3-0-9 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Intensive coverage of precision engineering
theory, heuristics, and applications pertaining
to the design of systems ranging from consumer products to machine tools. Topics
covered include: economics, project management, and design philosophy; principles of accuracy, repeatability, and resolution; error
budgeting; sensors; sensor mounting; systems
design; bearings; actuators and transmissions.
Emphasis on developing creative designs
which are optimized by analytical techniques
applied via spreadsheets. Many real-world examples are given, and classwork and tests are
based on mini-design problems.
