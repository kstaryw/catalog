21 F.303, 21 F.304, 21 F.403, 21 F.404,
21 F.503, 21 F.504, 21 F.703, or 21 F.704) for
one HASS-D subject. Of the two remaining
HASS-D subjects, one must be taken from
categories 4 or 5 and the other from one of
the remaining categories. Students selecting this language option may not choose a
second distribution subject taught in the
same foreign language or literature.
All foreign language subjects I-IV are open
