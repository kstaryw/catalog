0-18-0 Institute LAB
During January, practices methods of modern
geological field study during an intensive fourweek excursion. Exercises include geological
mapping on topographic and photographic
base maps, correlating geochemical and
geophysical field measurements with geology,
examining and sampling a wide variety of
geological features. Following term includes 1)
preparation of reports based on field studies
conducted during January, and 2) laboratory
analysis of samples, interpretation of geological, geophysical, and geochemical data. 12
units may be applied to the General Institute
Laboratory Requirement.

2-6-4 Institute LAB
Focuses on analytical facilities that are used to
determine elemental and isotopic abundances
in soils, rocks, minerals, and fluids. Emphasis
is on isotopic ratios Sr, Nd, and Pb, whose
isotopic ratios can be used for age dating, and
abundances of trace elements such as Rb, Sr,
Cu, Cd, Hg, rare-earths, Pb, Th, and U. Analytical techniques include mass spectrometry,
emission spectrometry, atomic absorption,
neutron activation, and electron microprobe. A
major lab project utilizes these techniques to
address specific environmental and geologic
problems. Each student generates a report
that may be used to satisfy Phase II of the Writing Requirement.
