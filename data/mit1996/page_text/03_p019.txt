The senses are our gateways to the world.
Everything we know about what is going on
out there comes to us through vision, hearing,
touch, taste, smell. How do the senses work?
How do physical stimuli get transduced into signals in the nervous system? How can the brain
use those signals to determine the flavor of a
banana, the sound of a flute, or the shape of a
cow? All senses discussed. Vision is covered
