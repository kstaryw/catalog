Project must integrate biology and engineering
or medicine and engineering. Approval of the
CBE Curriculum committee required. Students
must enroll for at least 12 units in the term the
work is done in order to receive credit as a
restricted elective in the BME Minor. Consult
the departmental BME Minor advisor early in
the term. Can be used to fulfill Phase 11.

Prereq.: 5.11, 10.213, 10.37
G (Fall)
3-0-6 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Chemical and engineering principles involved
in creation and operation of viable industrial
processes. Topics: analysis of process
chemistry by p-pathways (i.e., radical, ionic,
and pericyclic reactions of organic syntheses)
and d-pathways (i.e., catalysis by transitionmetal complexes). Use of reaction
mechanisms for inference of co-product formation, kinetics, and equilibria: process synthesis
logic related to reaction selectivity, recycle,
separations. Illustrations drawn from current
and contemplated commercial practice.
