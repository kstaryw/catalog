Color is perceived, not measured: any composition of light can be made to appear as any
hue. The views of scientists and artists on
color are different and complementary.
Modern image processing uses methods previously developed by artists and also used in
protective coloration of animals. Ancient
science is distinct from ancient practical
knowledge as embodied in the arts. The interplays between architecture, astronomy, and
astronomical myths are studied. Travesties on
science are read as criticism.
