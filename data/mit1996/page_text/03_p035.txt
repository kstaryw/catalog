G (Spring)
3-0-9 [P/D/FJ
Presents a framework for current landscape
ecological theory, structured to encourage application in physical planning of landscapes.
Case studies link theory to practice, and include both urban and rural landscapes.
Science and planning are examined as social
practices which rely on situated knowledge.
Past and present methods of ecological planning are reviewed and critiqued in a student
project. Major topics include biodiversity, cyclical processes, assessment of landscape structures, and design for sustainability.
