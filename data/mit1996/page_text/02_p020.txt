A seminar for graduate trainees in the
"Chemistry of the Environment" program, and
open to other interested graduate and advanced undergraduate students, which addresses technical, economic, political, and
environmental issues of chemistry and society.
Seminar is intended to give trainees participating in individual research groups that address
widely different aspects of chemistry some
common ground for thinking about environmental issues, and to develop a wide range of
views about how society should deal with the
interactions between chemical technology and
the environment.
