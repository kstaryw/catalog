Surveys some important ways in which culture
has been conceived by anthropologists, social
historians, and political scientists such as
Geertz, Sahlins, Scott, Laitin, Wildavsky,
Sagan, Said, Hobsbawm, and Obeyesekere;
and investigates how such conceptions have
been used to interpret or explain the political
world. In particular, examines how culture, in
its various incarnations, has figured into explanations or interpretations of charisma, ideology, national identity, democratic stability, the
rise of the state, resistance and revolt, and the
functioning of electoral institutions.
