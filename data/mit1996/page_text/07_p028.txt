22.562J Spatial Aspects of Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
(Same subject as HST.562J)
Prereq.: 22.56J or permission of instructor
G (Fall)
3-0-9 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Discusses the theory and application of
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to
questions of the spatial distribution of spins.
Covers NMR imaging, localized spectroscopy,
and local geometries as determined by diffusive processes. The theory is discussed in
terms of the density operator and reciprocal
space (for both imaging and motional studies).
Describes applications to rapid imaging,
dynamic imaging, microscopy, and localized
spectroscopy. Instrumentation and experimental constraints are also described.

22.57J Radiation Biophysics
(Same subject as HST.568J)
Prereq.: 22.101
G (Fall)
4-0-8 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Discusses ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and heat and their effects on biological
materials, cells, and tissues. Examines in vivo
and in vitro mammalian systems, and explores
mathematical models for cell survival, emphasizing prediction. Covers radiation therapy,
radiation syndromes in humans, and carcinogenesis. Environmental radiation sources
also discussed.

Introduces many of the pertinent areas of research and concern in the field of Radiation
Health Physics. Topics of weekly seminars include radiation shielding, waste management,
environmental behaviour of radioactivity, medical irradiations, methods of detection and
dosimetry, dose reduction, and the regulatory
and legal aspects of radiation; student presentations also required.
