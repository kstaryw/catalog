Examines the neural bases of visual and
auditory processing for perception and sensorimotor control. Focuses on physiological
and anatomical studies of the mammalian nervous system as well as behavioral studies of
animals and humans. Studies visual pattern,
color and depth perception, auditory responses and speech coding, and spatial localization. Offered alternate years.

Surveys general principles and specific examples of motor control in biological systems.
Empnasizes the neural mechanisms underlying different aspects of movement. Covers sensory reception, reflex arcs, spinal cord
organization, pattern generators, muscle function, locomotion, and eye movement. Functions of central motor structures including
cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and
cerebral cortex considered. Motor learning and
computational approaches to motor control are
discussed.

Reviews selected issues including learning,
cognition, perception, foraging and feeding,
migration and navigation, defense, and social
activities including conflict, collaboration,
courtship and reproduction, and communication. The interacting contributions of environment and heredity are examined and the
approaches of psychology, ethology, and ecology to this area of study are treated. The relation of human behavior patterns to those of
nonhuman animals is explored.

Acad Year 1997-98: Not offered
3-0-6 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Survey and special topics designed for
graduate students in the brain and cognitive
sciences. Emphasizes ethological studies of
natural behavior and its analysis in laboratory
work, with contributions from field studies,
sociobiology, and comparative psychology.
Stresses mammalian behavior but also includes studies of other vertebrates and of invertebrates. Discussions include human
ethology, applications to neuropsychology and
behavioral pharmacology, and welfare of captive animals. Alternate years.
