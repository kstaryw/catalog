This advanced-level subject deals with various
topics in the transmission of vibrational energy
through structures, and the interaction of structural vibrations with surrounding and contained
fluid regions. Faculty members will lead discussions of these topics using published papers
and research reports. Topics will vary depending on research activities in the Structural
Acoustics Program. A good background in
dynamics, applied mathematics, and structural
mechanics will be assumed. Background
courses in acoustics and structural wave
propagation are recommended.
