Central topics in first language acquisition and
real-time language comprehension. How does
a child acquire language despite impoverished
output? What makes language easy or hard to
understand? Experimental methodology and
explicit models are discussed. An emphasis on
the relation of linguistic principles to the
problems of language acquisition and real-time
processing. Discussion of computational

Introduces the principles of experimental
design and interpretation in cognitive psychology, including an overview of inferential statistics and analyses of common sources of
artifact. Demonstration of experiments in a
number of areas of cognitive science. Students design, execute, and write up an experiment of their own. Graduate students required
to do additional reading and more technically
demanding assignments.

3-0-9 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Study of representation, processing, and adaptation in highly interconnected networks of
simple analog processing units. Explores basic
algorithms, including backpropagation,
Boltzmann machines, mixtures of experts,
recurrent algorithms, hidden Markov models,
and junction tree propagation. Emphasizes the
ties to dynamical systems and statistics. Applications to models of memory, perception,
reasoning, and motor control.
