Seminar provides students a unique opportunity to tackle original research problems in
financial engineering that have been posed by
leading industry experts from the financial community. These experts - partners of companies, managing directors etc. - provide
students with current problems in financial engineering that they are currently facing in their
businesses, with the restriction that the
problems must be as yet unsolved. Students
are assigned to teams and each team is assigned one such problem. The team's solution
is then presented at a seminar open to the entire MIT community.

The proseminar has two principal goals: to
bridge the gap between finance theory and
finance practice; and to introduce students to
the broader financial community. Both are accomplished by student participation in a series
of proseminars with guest speakers from industry. Each guest, in collaboration with
finance faculty, provides a problem and
materials to a team of students. Each team
then prepares a report and presents their
analysis to the guest speaker and other students for evaluation and feedback.
