Approaches to develop computer models of
physical and engineering systems: objectoriented methodologies to model structure,
numerical analysis approaches to model behavior. Introduction to object orientation, C++,
and the Object-Oriented Modeling Technique.
Numerical solutions to differentiation, integration, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, characteristic-value
problems, and curve-fitting. These techniques
used to model various engineering systems.
Strong background in C programming, calculus, and differential equations recommended.

History of private and public rights in scientific
discoveries and applied engineering, leading
to the development of worldwide patent systems. The classes of invention protectable
under the patent laws of the US, including the
procedures in protecting inventions in the
Patent Office and the courts. Reviews of past
cases involving inventions and patents in a)
the chemical process industry and medical and
bio-engineering fields; b) devices in the
mechanical, ocean exploration, civil, and/or
aeronautical fields; c) the electrical, computer,
software, and electronic areas, including key
radio, solid-state, and computer inventions.
