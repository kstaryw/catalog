Introduces the fundamentals of three-dimensional geometric modeling and associated
computer-aided design and visualization applications in architecture, urban design,
product design, and computer animation.
Provides a theoretical foundation, an introduction to a selection of current hardware and
software tools, and extensive opportunities to
develop practical skills through hands-on lab
sessions and regular practical exercises. A
background of computational skills is an advantage, but not required. Successful completion enables students to acquire the skills
necessary to undertake independent CAD and
computer animation in design studios and
professional settings, and to undertake more
advanced subjects in this area.
