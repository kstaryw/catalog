The rise of major fields in the life sciences in
America from 1879 to 1950, with emphasis on
the historical processes by which American culture, ideology, economics, and biology have
become intertwined. Examines research
programs in physiology, endocrinology,
biochemistry, genetics, eugenics, "psychobiology," and molecular biology as embedded in
power relations such as race, class, and
gender. Studies the questions of nature vs nurture, pure vs applied science, and vested interests vs objectivity. May be taken by qualified
undergraduates with permission of the instructor.
