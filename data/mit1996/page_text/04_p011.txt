Introduces the basic relevant principles and
concepts in atmospheric chemistry and
physics, climate dynamics, biogeochemistry,
and environmental policy making, through an
examination of two current problems in the
global environment: 1) carbon dioxide and
global warming, and 2) chlorofluorocarbons
and ozone. An introduction to global environmental problems for students in basic sciences
and engineering.

12.305 Global Atmospheric Pollution
Prereq.: 8.02
U (Fall)
2-0-4
Increasing industrial activity and biomass burnings have produced pollution patterns now
detectable world-wide. In 1996-97, subject
concentrates on material reaching the atmosphere from Pacific Rim countries and
measured over the Pacific from specially instrumented aircraft in 1991, 1994, and 1996.
Space shuttle measurements on global carbon
monoxide also discussed. Atmospheric and
oceanic structure necessary to understand the
transport processes and photochemical sources and sinks of constituents, which in some
cases provide natural removal processes, is
presented. Students examine possible sources, including fossil fuel use, volcanic activity,
biomass burning, and oceanic biosphere.
