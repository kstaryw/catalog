Describes the principles that govern the chemical behavior of terrestrial and planetary atmospheres. Reviews chemical reactions and
biogeochemical cycles that control the abundance of trace species in the troposphere and
stratosphere. Emphasis is placed on the potentially damaging effects of human activity on the
chemical balance of the atmosphere. Covers
stratospheric ozone depletion, regional and
local photochemical smog, and greenhouse
gases.
