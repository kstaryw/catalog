Are there ahistorical standards of scientific
rationality? Many philosophers working within
the mainstream tradition of Anglo-American
analytic philosophy would like to think so; yet
their attempts at precisely elucidating such
standards have met with rather spectacular
failure when tested against the history of
science. One response to this failure is to insist that all scientific knowledge is "socially constructed." But is this really the only response
available? Subject seeks to answer - or at
least to develop - this question via the study
of some recent philosophical work on scientific
rationality, together with detailed examination
of one or two relevant episodes in the history
of physics.
