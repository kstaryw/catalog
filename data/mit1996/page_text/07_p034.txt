Can we know anything at all, and if so, how do
we do it? How much of what we ordinarily take
to be our knowledge really deserves the
name? Exploration of these central epistemological issues via examination of a range
of philosophically significant skeptical arguments, focusing on arguments due to Descartes, Hume, Goodman, and Kripke/Wittgenstein. Emphasis on the role of underdetermination of theory by data in motivating skeptical positions, philosophical themes which unify
these positions, importance of skepticism in
guiding philosophical inquiry.
