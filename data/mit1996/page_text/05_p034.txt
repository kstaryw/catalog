"Institutional economics" investigates the idea
that competitive markets depend on institutions that are deliberately designed and organized, rather than arising from spontaneous,
uncoordinated pursuit of profit. Although
recently popularized as the "new institutional
economics," these themes were analyzed in
detail by early twentieth-century theorists such
as Weber and Veblen. Provides an introduction to both the old and new institutional
economics, and investigates the implication of
their analyses for the central concerns of com- parative political economy.
