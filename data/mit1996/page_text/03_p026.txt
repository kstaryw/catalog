Chain macromolecules as random coils (unperturbed, expanded) and as other shapes. Statistical thermodynamics of interpenetrating
random coiling polymers in solution with application to phase separations, swelling of networks, depression of melting point. The
isolated chain molecule in dilute solutions
analyzed for mass or size by static methods
(osmometry, light scattering, neutron scattering) and by dynamic methods (intrinsic viscosity, size exclusion chromatography,
sedimentation).

10.569 Synthesis of Polymers
Prereq.: 5.12
G (Spring)
3-0-6 H-LEVEL Grad Credit
Studies synthesis of polymeric materials, emphasizing interrelationships of chemical pathway, process conditions, and
"microarchitecture" of molecules produced.
Chemical pathway: anionic, radical, condensation, ring-opening. Process conditions: bulk,
solution, emulsion, suspension, gas phase,
batch vs continuous fluidized bed. "Microarchitecture": tacticity, molecular-weight distribution, sequence distributions in copolymers,
"errors" in chains such as branches, head-tohead addition, peroxide incorporation.
