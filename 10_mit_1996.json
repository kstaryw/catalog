Applies these analytical and policy\nframeworks to case-studies on resource\nmanagement (e.g., soil erosion, water,\nfisheries) and industrialization (e.g., on energy,\nhazardous wastes).\nV.

A systematic rather than historical approach. Readings from classical and contemporary sources, but emphasis is on examination and evaluation of proposed solutions to the problems. J. Thomson, V. McGee 24.01 Philosophy and Public Affairs 24.02 What is the Best Way to Live? (New) Acad Year 1996-97: Not offered Acad Year 1997-98: U (Fall, Spring) 3-0-9 HASS Issues such as abortion, punishment, and pornography are emotionally laden and practically urgent. It is easy to have opinions on such matters, but difficult to think them through. Learning to think clearly and systematically about concrete issues is the point of this subject. Focus is on the critical examination of the arguments presented by the authors read, but broad aim is for student to develop the capacity for self-reflection about concrete moral issues. Staff U (Fall) 3-0-9 HASS-D, Category 2 What is the best way to live? How important is moral integrity, or personal happiness, or individual autonomy and self-expression, if one is to live in the best way that one can? Examines classics texts from the history of Western philosophy, and some literary, nonphilosophical texts, bearing on these questions. These texts include works by Sophocles, Thucydides, Plato, Kant, Schiller, J. S. Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, and Dickens. Emphasis on close analysis and evaluation of philosophical ideas and arguments. R. Wedgwood 24.03 Relativism, Reason, and Reality U (Spring) 3-0-9 HASS-D, Category 2 An examination of philosophical issues on the theme of relativism. Are moral standards relative to cultures and/or moral frameworks? Are there incompatible or non-comparable ways of thinking about the world that are somehow equally good? Can any sense be made of the idea that truth is relative? Is rationality - the notion of a good reason to believe something - relative to cultural norms? Is the idea of a completely objective description of the world incoherent? Discussion of these questions through the writings of contemporary philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, Nelson Goodman, Bernard Williams, and Hilary Putnam. Emphasis on ways of making these vague questions precise, and critical evaluation of philosophical arguments. A.

Students are exposed to some of the practical realities of providing patient care. Topics covered include basic interviewing, issues of ethics and confidentiality, and other aspects of the doctor-patient relationship. Requirements include regular attendance, and a short paper on patient care. Enrollment limited to 15. W. M. Kettyle, A. N.

Students form a group medical practice and participate in the longitudinal management of medically fragile patients. Under the supervision of physician-preceptors, students regularly visit patients at home and in the hospital, and address relevant medical, ethical, financial, and organizational issues. Students begin the subject in the fall of the second year of the MD curriculum and are expected to continue the subject for a minimum of one year. C. DuBeau, R. Mark, P.

Schmandt MAS.100 Introduction to Media Arts and Sciences U (Spring) 3-0-3 Examines new technologies and applications in information and entertainment, perceptual computing, learning and common sense. Explores the convergence of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, with emphasis on the human interface, machine intelligence, and personalized media. Includes introductions to holography, computer graphics, interactive cinema, electronic music, digital television, machine vision, speech processing, interface agents, and interface physics. Large projects on world activities in these areas. N. P. Negroponte MAS.123 Tools for Thought MAS.124 Intentionality (New) U (Spring) 3-3-6 Examines how technological tools support new ways of thinking and learning. Considers the role of toys, microworlds, \"intelligent\" tutors, and virtual communities in the learning process. Emphasizes the use of artifacts as representational and expressive aids for learning, problem-solving, and communication. Students explore tools-to-think with, analyze them, and design new ones. M. Resnick, M. Brand, J. Cassell U (Spring) 2-4-6 Often it is not what is said, but what one does that communicates one's intentions. Facial expressions, body or hand movements, gaze, tone of voice, pauses, or other sounds are examples. Similarly, the intentions of a group are read from the patterns of individual interactions and movements. Subject explores the basic forms of expressing intentionality both in individual and group settings, in both humans and other animals. Projects show how correct recognition and interpretation of intentional acts may be recovered, using situations such as conversation, strolling down the street, driving, dance (including animal behaviors), and sports such as soccer or football.
